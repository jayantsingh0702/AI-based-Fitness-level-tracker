# AI-Driven Fitness Level Predictor

A smart, user-centric web application designed to evaluate and predict overall fitness levels using advanced health parameters. This project leverages the power of Python and Flask to provide users with actionable insights into their physical well-being.

## 🚀 Overview

The **AI-Based Fitness Level Predictor** bridge the gap between complex health data and user understanding. By inputting basic health metrics, users receive an intelligent assessment of their current fitness standing, enabling them to make informed decisions about their lifestyle and health goals.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Predictive Analysis:** Uses machine learning logic to categorize fitness levels based on health metrics.
* **Modern Web Interface:** A clean, responsive UI built with HTML5 and CSS.
* **Real-time Processing:** Fast and efficient backend processing powered by Flask.
* **User-Friendly Design:** Simple input forms designed for ease of use by non-technical users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.11(stable), Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Logic:** Machine Learning algorithms for fitness classification

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayantsingh0702/AI-based-Fitness-level-tracker.git
cd AI-based-Fitness-level-tracker

```


2. **Set up a virtual environment (Optional but recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

```


3. **Install dependencies:**
*(Ensure you have downloaded the 'requirements.txt' file as well)*
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python app.py

```


5. **Access the App:**
Open your browser and navigate to `https://ai-based-fitness-level-predictor.onrender.com`

## 📊 How it Works

1. **Input:** Users provide data such as Age, BMI, Heart Rate, and Activity Levels.
2. **Processing:** The Flask backend processes this data through a trained model or algorithmic logic.
3. **Output:** The system returns a fitness category (e.g., Poor, Average, Good, Excellent) along with potential suggestions.
